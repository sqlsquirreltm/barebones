Barebones watch face for the Watchy

![Watchy](https://i.imgur.com/3RoCNnG.jpg)

I don't like complicated/busy watch faces. So I created a basic watch face that displays the current time in the middle of the face and a battery indicator in the top left. To change some of the settings look in barebones.h


Note:
This face is mostly pieces taken from the 7SEG example face.
